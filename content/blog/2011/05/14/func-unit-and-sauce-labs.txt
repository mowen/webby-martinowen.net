p. In work we've recently started using the "FuncUnit":http://funcunit.com/ automated web application testing framework. It is built on top of Selenium, but adds a lot of value as it uses jQuery's selector syntax, this is much easier to work with than Selenium RC's XPath selectors.

p. FuncUnit also provides many helper functions for waiting until elements exist on the page. This is invaluable if you are doing a lot of DOM manipulation, which we were.

p. Something we wanted to do with our functional testing was run the tests in different browser environments using "Sauce Labs":http://saucelabs.com/, a cloud-based cross-browser testing service, as this would save us from having to install older versions of various browsers. I wasn't sure if this was going to be possible, but with "some advice from Brian Moschel":http://forum.javascriptmvc.com/#topic/32525000000389015 I was able to get it working.

<notextile>
<% uv :lang => "javascript" do %>FuncUnit = {
    browsers: [
        JSON.stringify({ 
            username: "<your Sauce Labs username>", 
            "access-key": "<your Sauce Labs Api Key>",
            os: "Windows 2003",
            browser: "firefox",
            browser-version: "3.6.",
            name: "My Tests",
            "user-extensions-url": "http://<your server>/funcunit/java/user-extensions.js"
        })
    ],
   
    serverHost: 'ondemand.saucelabs.com',
    serverPort: 80,
    
    jmvcRoot: 'http://<your server>/'
};
<% end %>
</notextile>         

p. As long as you open your pages in your tests using @S.open('//index.html')@ the jmvcRoot will be applied and you will be able to test locally as well as on your server with Sauce Labs.
