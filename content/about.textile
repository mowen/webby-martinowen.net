h3. This Site

This site was built using the following tools:

* "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ the static site generator, itself implemented in the "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ programming language.
* "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ for formatting the content of the pages.
* "HAML":http://haml-lang.com/ for generating the markup.
* "SASS":http://sass-lang.com/ for generating the stylesheets, with help from the "Blueprint CSS framework":http://www.blueprintcss.org/, via "Compass":http://compass-style.org/.
* "Ultraviolet":http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/ and the many Textmate bundles for syntax highlighting the code.
* Everything was edited with "GNU Emacs":http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ 
* ... and version controlled by "Git":http://git-scm.com/ and "GitHub":http://github.com.
